the performance report for the assignment is as follows:

|Buyer/Seller|Avg Response time|Avg Throughput|

|1|                  86ms|         501|
|10|                242ms|         282|
|100|              1915ms|           -|

The latency has significantly increased with REST, plus since Node.js is single threaded and uses an event loop for asyncronous execution, all threads are not utilized. 
The client crashes when testing throughput for 100 users. 
We can see that the no of ops/second reduce, this is again due to poor multithreading on node.js and overloading of the event loop
