the performance report for the assignment is as follows:

Buyer/Seller	Avg Responce time	Avg Throughput
1	            2.78ms	            2907
10	            14.6ms	            4057
100	            125.3ms	            6893


The latency here is higher than expected because the buyer/seller server has to communicate
 with the database server in order to get data and put data. 
 So an additional socket connection has to be made.
  And also the print statements take a good amount of time to compute and print the result.
